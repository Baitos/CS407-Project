#Goal is to take in a png and generate the stage array for SDL in a 1:1. 
#Every element in the array is equal to 1 pixel. 

#You will be returned a 2d array with each unique RGBA value found 
# in the png is associated with a unique colorID

#You will also be returned each colorID's (x,y) coordinates where they were first encountered 
#Use the given (x,y) to determine what tile belongs with which ID 

#function call
