Hello! This repo is the result of watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu2g-N5Z78Y and is all about me learning SDL3!

In order to run this, you will need to download SDL3 and SDL3_image from their respective github links, and you will need to install the glm library as well and place it in a folder named ext (or modify the header file gameobject.h so that it can detect glm in a different directory) Then, with SDL3 and SDL3_image installed in their respective folders, modify the Makefile to apply to your SDL/SDL_image paths, and place the .dll files for both in this source directory.

game: game.cpp
	g++ -o game game.cpp -I "*\SDL\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include" -I "*\SDL3_image\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include" -L "*\SDL\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib" -lSDL3 -L "*\SDL3_image\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib" -lSDL3_image -std=c++20
clean:
	rm game.exe
# Replace * in the quoted sections with wherever you placed your SDL files (makefile)
